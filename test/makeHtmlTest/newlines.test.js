// Import the handleNewlines function from its specified location within the project structure.
// This function is designed to process text with newlines, likely transforming or removing
// newline characters as part of converting Markdown content into HTML format. Considering the
// varied ways newline characters can be interpreted in Markdown and HTML, this function's
// behavior could be crucial for rendering Markdown correctly in a web context.
const handleNewlines = require("../../src/makeHtml/newlines");

// Initiate a test suite named 'Newline Handling'.
// This suite groups tests that specifically assess how newline characters are treated
// during the Markdown to HTML conversion process. Given that different interpretations
// of newlines can significantly affect rendered content layout, ensuring correct handling
// is imperative for accurate Markdown rendering.

  // Define a single test case, focusing on whether the function removes newlines correctly.
  // This test looks at a specific aspect of newline handlingâ€”whether newline characters are
  // effectively removed or ignored in the conversion process, based on the expected behavior
  // described in comments and/or documentation.
  test("removes newlines correctly", () => {

    // the provided Markdown string. In this case, the expectation (based on the problem description)

    // in the HTML representation of the text.
    const expectedHtml = "Content followed by a newline"; // Assumes newline handling converts to HTML without the newline character.

    // Assert that the function's output for the provided markdown input matches exactly
    // the expected HTML output. The use of toBe here (instead of toContain) implies an exact match
    // is required, suggesting that the function should return the Markdown content with the newline character
    // wholly removed, not just transformed or replaced.
